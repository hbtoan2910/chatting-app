# Simple Chatting Application



## Introduction

I create a Realtime Chat Application with Firebase (Authentication/Realtime Database).

First thing in mind is to create a react chat app using [https://chatengine.io](https://chatengine.io) but somehow, chatengine no longer supports new user (I could not find signup/register section on their website ?!)

So, Firebase is also a great tool as alternative to setup apps fast and easily - great to learn with!

### Key notes:

In the app, we use 3 key services of Firebase which are:

  #### 1. import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth"; 
  //use Firebase Authentication service

  #### 2. import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore"; 
  //use Firestore Database service (for structured data: RealTime data storage like user info/chat message..)

  Within this, MUST use onSnapshot() function for a REAL TIME listener on a specific collection (in this app, collections are: 'userchats' and 'chats')

  #### 3. import { getStorage } from "firebase/storage"; 
  //use Firestore Storage service (storing & serving larger files like images/videos/audio files...)

Instead of using Redux to create store (state managment), we use Zustand - a light weight and compact state management library.

We cannot directly use conditional syntax in object literal notation without the spread operator (...)

Image download function:

Error: 

Access to fetch at 'https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/chatting-app-f24d5.appspot.com/o/avatars%2F20241106_154734_doubtful_cow.png?alt=media&token=8aac87b6-0d0b-41f3-9bfa-c5f618d7044d' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: 

No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled

Solution: 

Firebase Storage does not allow cross-origin requests (CORS) by default

To download data directly in the browser, you must configure your Cloud Storage bucket for cross-origin access (CORS). Firstly, install gsutil from https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install, then login with your gcloud credential on command line with gsutil

Create a JSON file named cors.json in root with content as below:

[
  {
    "origin": ["*"],
    "method": ["GET"],
    "maxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]

Run: gsutil cors set cors.json gs://<your-cloud-storage-bucket> to deploy these restrictions.

### Deploy using HEROKU

1. In your pc, download and install the Heroku CLI.

2. In Heroku website, create an app named 'ryandev-chatting-app'

3. CMD => type: heroku login

4. In your IDE (mine is VScode) > Terminal > type: git push heroku main

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03f12ca4-e4c1-4c26-a0aa-eee102ff95c8)

5. Go to your app > Settings, if you have .env file, go to Config Vars > Show Config Vars > add key-value in here. Forget this step, you can not authenticate your app properly.

6. Now your app is hosted in Heroku, use Heroku Git URL to access your published app. Have fun ! üòéüòÅ‚ù§
